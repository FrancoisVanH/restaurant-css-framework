## Missions objectives
At the end, improving the placement with Bootstrap.


## The plan
Making the html.
- [x] The welcome page (index.html) with a jumbotron and panels (cards in 5.0). 
- [x] The menu with a grouped list with badges.
- [x] The gallery with 10 pics in a carousel (and a gallery inside of it).
- [x] The restaurant with the address, map, and schedules. 
- [x] The contact page with a contact form and a commentary section.

### The work
I've proceed like a sort of die and retry.
I've done it step by step with the bootstrap doc aside, when I wanted to improve or wasn't happy with the result I looked on other sites.
